################################################################################################################################

SKYWARNPLUS:
  # Toggle SkywarnPlus operation entirely.
  Enable: true

################################################################################################################################

Asterisk:
  # List of node numbers for broadcasting alerts. Multiple nodes are specified as a list.
  # Example:
  # Nodes:
  #   - 1998
  #   - 1999
  Nodes:
    - YOUR_NODE_NUMBER

  # Optional silence to be added to the beginning of any audio files generated by SkywarnPlus.
  # This is useful for radio systems that require additional time to key up, such as RF links.
  # Silence is specified in milliseconds.
  AudioDelay: 0

################################################################################################################################

Alerting:
  # Specify the county codes for which you want to pull weather data.
  # Find your county codes at https://alerts.weather.gov/.
  # Make sure to use county codes ONLY, NOT zone codes, otherwise you might miss out on alerts.
  # Example:
  # CountyCodes:
  #   - ARC125
  #   - ARC119
  #
  # SkywarnPlus allows adding county-specific audio indicators to each alert in the message.
  # To enable this feature, specify an audio file containing a recording of the county name in the
  # ROOT of the SOUNDS/ directory as shown in the below example. You must create these files yourself.
  # A helper script is provided in the SkywarnPlus repository to help generate these files.
  # You can manually use the same VoiceRSS API used for SkyDescribe (see below) to generate these files with a synthetic voice:
  # http://api.voicerss.org/?key=[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]&hl=en-us&f=8khz_16bit_mono&v=John&src=[YOUR COUNTY NAME HERE]
  # http://api.voicerss.org/?key=1234567890QWERTY&hl=en-us&f=8khz_16bit_mono&v=John&src=Saline County
  # Example:
  # CountyCodes:
  #   - ARC125: "Saline.wav"
  #   - ARC119: "Pulaski.wav"
  CountyCodes:
    - YOUR_COUNTY_CODE

  # Enable instant voice announcement when new weather alerts are issued.
  SayAlert: true

  # Enable SayAlert to "say" any alerts whose list of affected counties has changed, in addition to new alerts.
  # Only applies if more than one CountyCode is specified AND County IDs have been setup.
  SayAlertsChanged: true

  # When a change is detected, make SayAlert say ALL of the currently active alerts, not just newly detected one(s)
  SayAlertAll: false

  # Specify the WAV file in the SOUNDS/ALERTS directory to use as the alert sound effect
  AlertSound: Duncecap.wav

  # Specify a WAV file in the root of the SOUNDS directory to be appended to the end of the alert message.
  SayAlertSuffix:

  # Enable instant voice announcement when weather alerts are cleared.
  SayAllClear: true

  # Specify the WAV file in the SOUNDS/ALERTS directory to use as the all clear sound effect.
  AllClearSound: Triangles.wav

  # Specify a WAV file in the root of the SOUNDS directory to be appended to the end of the all clear message.
  SayAllClearSuffix:
  
  # Specify the WAV file in the SOUNDS/ALERTS directory to use as the alert seperator sound effect
  AlertSeperator: Woodblock.wav

  # Enable audio tagging an alert as having "multiples" if there is more than one unique instance of that alert type
  # If enabled, and there are 2x different Severe Thunderstorm Warnings in your area, the audio will be: "Severe Thunderstorm Warning, with multiples"
  WithMultiples: true

  # Limit the maximum number of alerts to process in case of multiple alerts.
  # SkywarnPlus fetches all alerts, orders them by severity, and processes only the 'n' most severe alerts, where 'n' is the MaxAlerts value.
  MaxAlerts: 99

  # Specify an alternative path to the directory where sound files are located.
  # Default is SkywarnPlus/SOUNDS.
  SoundsPath: /usr/local/bin/SkywarnPlus/SOUNDS

  # 'TimeType' Configuration
  #
  # This setting determines the timing reference for issuing weather alerts.
  # You can choose between "onset" and "effective" time.
  #
  # 'onset': Alerts are issued based on the predicted start time of the event.
  # This means the system will only send out alerts when the events are imminent.
  # For example, even though a "Heat Advisory" can be forecasted accurately a day or two in advance,
  # the alert will only be sent close to the actual occurrence of the event.
  #
  # 'effective': Alerts are sent as soon as they are received, based on the effective time of the alert message.
  # The "effective" time is when the alert message is considered to be in effect,
  # which could be significantly earlier than the actual onset of the event.
  #
  # By using 'onset', you can ensure that alerts are relevant and timely for the recipients.
  TimeType: onset

################################################################################################################################

Blocking:
  # List of globally blocked events. These alerts are ignored across the entire SkywarnPlus operation.
  # Use a case-sensitive list. Wildcards can be used.
  # Example:
  # GlobalBlockedEvents:
  #   - Flood Watch
  #   - '*Statement'
  #   - '*Advisory'
  GlobalBlockedEvents:

  # List of events blocked from being announced when received. These alerts will still be added to the tail message.
